# Navgesh-Follower
Basic intro of navmesh:
A **navigation mesh, or navmesh,** is an abstract data structure used in artificial intelligence applications to aid agents in pathfinding through complicated spaces. 
**NavMeshAgent** components help you to create characters which avoid each other while moving towards their goal. Agents reason about the game world using the NavMesh. More info. See in Glossary and they know how to avoid each other as well as other moving obstacles.


This unity project consists of navmesh plane with a primitive object which is a navmesh agent. On hitting any point on plane, the object moves to that point.

**Note**
Navmesh agent never leaves plane. If you want to move youyr object out of plane, then yo have to use specific algorithm to move it.
